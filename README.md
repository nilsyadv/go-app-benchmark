# go-app-benchmark
A benchmark is a type of function that executes a code segment multiple times and compares each output against a standard, assessing the codeâ€™s overall performance level. Golang includes built-in tools for writing benchmarks in the testing package and the go tool, so you can write useful benchmarks without installing any dependencies.
